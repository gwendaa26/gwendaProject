//  This page is showing the detail from the list of country. The user will be directed to this page, when they clicked one of country from the list. It will declare some of information from the country.
//  I was helped by a source from youtube to finalize this task, by displaying the detail that obtained from the API (Rest Countries), which the code was already written in detailViewController.
